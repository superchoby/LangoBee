To count these objects in Japanese, we would attach the normal number kanji, and then add it right in front of the counter.",

      "content" : "Japanese actually has a LOT of different counters that are suited depending on the object we are talking about. <br></br> <br></br> If I wanted to count, long, cylyndrical objects, I would use what is known as the \u672c counter which is read as \u307b\u3093, the same way it is read for it's meaning, \"book.\" For example, 9 books would be \u4e5d\u672c\uff08\u304d\u3085\u3046\u307b\u3093). There are some exceptions where the readings changed slightly and some rendaku occurs for example 1 book is \u3044\u3063\u307d\u3093 not \u3044\u3061\u307b\u3093. Luckily, these sort of scenarios where the reading slightly changes is a very common pattern among counters that you get used to really quickly. <br></br> <br></br> Although there are many, many Japanese counters, there is one that is by far the most important and it is simply known as the general coutner because uou really can use it for any situation if you really wanted to. Although it may be weird sometimes to use it, if you ever forget or don't know the proper counter for a word, you can always use this. This counter has a completely special set of readings that you will learn in the next lesson but just to give you a quick preview, some examples would be: (\u4e00\u3064, \u3072\u3068\u3064), (\u4e94\u3064, \u3044\u3064\u3064), (\u5341, \u3068\u304a). You can see they have quite special readings right? Also, keep note the last example, \u5341 is not read as \u3058\u3085\u3046 but as \u3068\u304a in this case and does not have a \u3064 at the end, this is very unique.",
