One example of a katakana word is ペン( pen) and means, you guessed it, \"pen\". <subheader>Kanji</subheader> The symbols used to represent meanings. A hiragana character represents a \"sound\" like the sound \"ah\" while a kanji character would represent a meaning like \"water\". They are often used together with other kanji or hiragana to make a word and depending on the word, the pronunciation of the kanji varies.",

      "content": "Almost all Kanji have significantly more strokes than Hiragana and Katakana characters. What is good about them though is that there are many kanji that share the same components for example the kanji for old(古) and ten(十) both have the component that looks like a cross 十.  <br></br> <br></br> Radicals are the building blocks or roots of kanji. Kanji often consist of radicals and other kanji characters inside of them. We will be learning kanji from the ground up based on its components. Before you learn any kanji, you will have learned its components already so instead of looking at a kanji by it's individual stroke, some of which could have upwards of 15 or 20, we will break it down so that often, you can just memorize the kanji by a few radicals which greatly simplifies the learning process. <br></br> <br></br> So let's get started on this fun kanji journey!",

Naturally, some of these Chinese words were adopted as well and their readings were kept the same. This created the \"onyomi\" reading of the kanji. The literal meaning of onyomi is \"sound reading\" and that explains exactly what Onyomi is, the Chinese derived sound/reading of the kanji. <subheader>Kunyomi</subheader> Of course, when Chinese characters were adopted, Japanese already had it's own words. These Kanji characters were then also given the reading of the original Japanese words that had the same meaning. Essentially, kunyomi is the original Japanese reading.",

This character's chinese reading is shān and when this character became integrated into Japanese kanji it took the Onyomi (Chinese derived reading) さん(san). See the similarity? At the same time, in Japanese there was already a word for mountain called やま(yama). So since the Chinese character 山 meant \"mountain\" and the word for mountain in Japnaese was やま, the kanji 山 was given the reading やま!",

      "content": "Many Japanese characters contain multiple kunyomi and onyomi readings. This presents a challenge as it can make it hard to know whether a word uses the onyomi or kunyomi reading of a kanji and which. <br></br> <br></br> What is good news though is that there are general rules for when onyomi or kunyomi is used and there are many kanji that have multiple onyomi or kunyomi but only use one of them for the most part. <br></br> <br></br> As a rule of thumb, words that only have kanji, no hiragana or katakana, and use multiple of them, use the onyomi readings. These words consisting multiple kanji and only kanji, are called compound words, or じゅくご in Japanese which we will refer to them by <br></br> <br></br> Many Japanese words consist of just one kanji either with or without okurigana, the hiragana that comes after it, for example in the word 大きい meaning (big), the きい is called the okurigana. These words are generally read with the kunyomi reading. For the example the kunyomi of the \"person\" kanji (人) is ひと and the word 人 is read as ひと as the kunyomi is used. <br></br> <br></br> As mentioned earlier these are just general rules but there are definitely a fair amount of exceptions. We will teach them to you as the words come along!",
