One example of a katakana word is ペン(pen) and means, you guessed it, \"pen\".\n\n### Kanji\n\nThe symbols used to represent meanings. A hiragana character represents a \"sound\" like the sound \"ah\" while a kanji character would represent a meaning like \"water\". They are often used together with other kanji or hiragana to make a word and depending on the word, the pronunciation of the kanji varies.\n",

      "slug": "what-is-kanji",
      "body": "\n## Introduction\n\nThe third Japanese writing system that was adopted from Chinese. Unlike hiragana and katakana, kanji characters don't simply represent a pronunciation like the characters あ or ヤ for example.\n\nKanji characters represent meanings and correspond to a word. Combining the characters allows us to create even more words. For example, combining the kanji for \"fire\" and \"mountain\" make the word \"volcano\".\n\n## How we will learn them\n\nAlmost all Kanji have significantly more strokes than Hiragana and Katakana characters. What is good about them though is that there are many kanji that share the same components, for example, the kanji for old (古) and ten (十) both have the component that looks like a cross 十.\n\nRadicals are the building blocks or roots of kanji. Kanji often consist of radicals and other kanji characters inside of them. Here at Langobee we learn kanji from the ground up based on its components. Before you learn any kanji, you will have learned its components already so instead of looking at a kanji by its individual stroke, some of which could have upwards of 15 or 20, we will break it down so that often, you can just memorize the kanji by a few radicals which greatly simplifies and speeds up the learning process.\n\nSo let's get started on this fun kanji journey!",

      "title": "Kanji Readings",
      "slug": "kanji-readings",
      "body": "\n## How the readings work\n\nAlmost all Japanese consist of two readings known as Onyomi and Kunyomi.\n\n### Onyomi\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Kanji is a writing system that was adopted from Chinese. Naturally, some of these Chinese words were adopted as well and their readings were kept the same. This created the \"onyomi\" reading of the kanji. The literal meaning of onyomi is \"sound reading\" and that explains exactly what Onyomi is, the Chinese derived sound/reading of the kanji.\n\n### Kunyomi\n\nOf course, when Chinese characters were adopted, Japanese already had it's own words. These Kanji characters were then also given the reading of the original Japanese words that had the same meaning. Essentially, kunyomi is the original Japanese reading.\n\n## Example\n\nLet's take a look at the kanji for mountain, 山. This character's chinese reading is shān and when this character became integrated into Japanese kanji it took the Onyomi (Chinese derived reading) さん(san). See the similarity? At the same time, in Japanese there was already a word for mountain called やま(yama). So since the Chinese character 山 meant \"mountain\" and the word for mountain in Japanese was やま, the kanji 山 was given the reading やま!\n\n## How are they used in Vocabulary?\n\nMany Japanese characters contain multiple kunyomi and onyomi readings. This presents a challenge as it can make it hard to know whether a word uses the onyomi or kunyomi reading of a kanji and which.\n\nWhat is good news though is that there are general rules for when onyomi or kunyomi is used and there are many kanji that have multiple onyomi or kunyomi but only use one of them for the most part.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, words that only have kanji, no hiragana or katakana, and use multiple of them, use the onyomi readings. These words consisting multiple kanji and only kanji, are called compound words, or じゅくご in Japanese which we will refer to them by.\n\nMany Japanese words consist of just one kanji either with or without okurigana, the hiragana that comes after it, for example in the word 大きい meaning (big), the きい is called the okurigana. These words are generally read with the kunyomi reading. For example, the kunyomi of the \"person\" kanji (人) is ひと and the word 人 is read as ひと as the kunyomi is used.\n\nAs mentioned earlier these are just general rules but there are definitely a fair amount of exceptions. We will teach them to you as the words come along!\n",

      "title": "Japanese Counters",
      "slug": "japanese-counters",
      "body": "\n## Japanese Counting System\n\nSo you have learned the numbers in Japanese which obviously is very useful but one thing to note about Japanese is that objects aren't simply counted with just plain old 一, 二, 三 etc. There are different counters in Japanese suited for different objects. To count these objects in Japanese, we would attach the normal number kanji, and then add it right in front of the counter. \n\n## Some Common Counters\n\nJapanese actually has a LOT of different counters that are suited depending on the object we are talking about.\n\nIf I wanted to count, long, cylindrical objects, I would use what is known as the 本 counter which is read as ほん, the same way it is read for its meaning, \"book.\" For example, 9 books would be 九本（きゅうほん). There are some exceptions where the readings changed slightly and some rendaku occurs for example 1 book is いっぽん not いちほん. Luckily, these sort of scenarios where the reading slightly changes is a very common pattern among counters that you get used to really quickly.\n\nAlthough there are many, many Japanese counters, there is one that is by far the most important and it is simply known as the general counter because you really can use it for any situation if you really wanted to. Although it may be weird sometimes to use it, if you ever forget or don't know the proper counter for a word, you can always use this. This counter has a completely special set of readings that you will learn in the next lesson but just to give you a quick preview, some examples would be: (一つ, ひとつ), (五つ, いつつ), (十, とお). You can see they have quite special readings right? Also, keep note the last example, 十 is not read as じゅう but as とお in this case and does not have a つ at the end, this is very unique.\n        ",

      "slug": "hiragana-vs-katakana",
      "body": "\n## Introduction\n\nJapanese is a unique and fascinating language, made up of three distinct scripts: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Today, we will delve deeper into the world of Hiragana and Katakana. We'll understand their differences, their uses, and how mastering them can enhance your Japanese language journey. \n\n## The Difference Between Hiragana and Katakana\n\nHiragana and Katakana, referred to collectively as ‘kana’, are both phonetic, meaning each character represents a specific sound. However, they are used in different contexts:\n\n- Hiragana is often used for native Japanese words and grammar elements. It's the first script taught to Japanese children and is the backbone of the language.\n\n- Katakana, on the other hand, is primarily used for foreign words, onomatopoeia, and for stylistic purposes, such as emphasis or to represent robotic speech in comics.\n\nWhile their functions are different, the phonetic sounds in both scripts are identical. Each has 46 basic characters, and corresponding characters in Hiragana and Katakana represent the same sounds. However, their visual forms are different, making them easy to distinguish.\n\nFor example, compare the Hiragana character う with its Katakana counterpart ウ. \n### う ウ\nAs a rule of thumb, Hiragana is known for having smoother lines while Katakana is known for being more angular.\n\n## When to Use Hiragana vs Katakana\n\nIn general, Hiragana is used for native Japanese words and grammar elements, while Katakana is used for foreign words and onomatopoeia. However, there are exceptions and nuances to these rules. For instance, Katakana is sometimes used for emphasis or to create a certain aesthetic in writing. These distinctions become clear the more you get exposed to the language. \n\nIt is also important to note that context matters. The choice between Hiragana and Katakana isn't always black and white. It can often depend on the context. \n\n- Advertising: Companies may use Katakana to make their products seem more foreign and exotic. Conversely, they may use Hiragana to make their products seem more approachable to Japanese consumers.\n- Social Media: Many Japanese people use a mix of Hiragana and Katakana when writing online, depending on the context and their personal preferences. For instance, Katakana may be used for emphasis or to convey a playful tone, while Hiragana may be used to express more nuanced emotions.\n- Academic Writing: In academic writing, Hiragana is often used for particles and verb endings, while Katakana is used for technical terms and foreign words.\n\nUnderstanding these contexts will help you use Hiragana and Katakana more effectively. LangoBee's comprehensive lessons and real-world examples can help you understand these nuances and apply them in your own writing​​.\n## Conclusion\nMastering the Japanese language requires an understanding of Hiragana and Katakana. These scripts, while different in their uses and visual forms, are both essential for reading and writing Japanese words and sentences. With LangoBee's comprehensive lessons, interactive tools, and special review system, you can navigate the complex world of Japanese scripts with ease and confidence.

      "title": "How Long Does It Take to Learn Japanese? - A Comprehensive Guide",
      "slug": "how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-japanese",
      "body": "\n## Introduction\n\nThe question, \"how long does it take to learn Japanese?\", is quite common among language learners. The process of learning a new language can indeed seem daunting, particularly with one as intricate as Japanese. However, a step-by-step guide can help you understand the process and the estimated time each step might take.\n\n## Learning to Read Hiragana\n**Estimated Time: 2 days to 1 week**\n\nHiragana, often likened to the Japanese alphabet, forms the cornerstone of your Japanese language journey. It comprises 46 basic characters, each representing a unique sound. One of the best ways to learn this is through the use of mnemonics. By relating the hiragana characters to things you know/can imagine, it becomes much easier to remember.\n\n![Eel い mnemonic](https://langobee.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mnemonic_images/%E3%81%84.png)\n\nThis is an example for the character **い** (i) which is pronounced like the “ee” in “eels”. We can think of the Hiragana い as looking like two **ee**ls. With mnemonic strategies like this, we can greatly speed up the process of learning both the appearance and the sound of the hiragana. You can find many more mnemonics to help you learn Japanese here at [LangoBee](https://langobee.com/signup/).\n\nThrough the use of such memory techniques, you can speed up the process of being able to recognize Hiragana characters.\n\n## Learning to Read Katakana\n**Estimated Time: 2 days to 1 weeks**\n\nThe methodology of learning Katakana parallels that of Hiragana, albeit with some additional intricacies. The objective remains the same, i.e., to reach a point where you can comfortably read all Katakana characters and just like Hiragana, we have mnemonics that you can use to pick up Katakana quickly such as this for the katakana **二** (ni) which sounds like the “nee” in “needle”. The mnemonic for this would be, \n\n![Needle 二 mnemonic](https://langobee.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mnemonic_images/%E3%83%8B.png)\n\nLook! You can see two **nee**dles laying right on their side.\n\n## Learning Kanji:\n**Estimated Time: 1-2 years**\n\nKanji characters, although initially intimidating, are crucial for comprehensive Japanese language proficiency. They are Japanese characters that, unlike Hiragana and Katakana, represent a specific meaning and have multiple readings, which is what presents a large challenge with remembering them all in addition to the fact that there are so many that you need to memorise, around 2000. Traditional memorization methods in the classroom involve rote learning, which could take several years. Just like Hiragana and Katakana, using mnemonics to help you learn the kanji’s meaning and reading will greatly speed up the process. What’s also helpful is a strategy we use at [LangoBee](https://langobee.com/signup/) where we take advantage of the fact that kanji is often made up of many components, so we teach those components first and use those as the building blocks to learn more kanji.\n\n## Building Your Vocabulary\n**Estimated Time: Varies widely but can be around 2-3 years with diligent study**\n\nYour studies in Kanji will naturally result in a broadening vocabulary. As you learn kanji, your vocabulary should grow as you learn the vocabulary that uses those kanji. However, it's essential to also pay attention to words that do not use Kanji. It’s good to have a system in place that will also teach you important, non-kanji vocabulary words. [LangoBee](http://langobee.com) is one resource that provides a structured course for you\n\n## Mastering Grammar\n**Estimated Time: Also varies widely but can be around 2-3 years with diligent study**\n\nThe realm of Japanese grammar is expansive, demanding a fair amount of patience, and consistent practice. Especially if English or any language similar to English is your native language, Japanese grammar will be especially difficult. It will almost feel like a completely new way of thinking at first but will be extremely rewarding once you get a grasp of it. Before learning grammar, we suggest that you learn a fair amount of vocabulary and kanji first so that you can build a good foundation for you to learn grammar. There’s not many ways you can practice grammar if you don’t have a good vocabulary base. At [LangoBee](https://langobee.com/signup/), we gradually introduce you to grammar after you learn a fair amount of nouns, adjectives, verbs etc… so that when you do learn grammar, you can practice them in a wide variety of situations.\n\n## Facing Challenges and Overcoming Plateaus\n**Estimated Time: N/A**\n\nInevitably, there will be periods when you might feel stuck or overwhelmed by the enormity of the task. Remember, this is a common occurrence in any learning journey. During such phases, persistence is key. I guarantee with enough practice, you can overcome any hurdle that you face when learning Japanese. There is nothing that is impossible to learn!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, the time required to learn Japanese can vary significantly, influenced by several factors such as your prior language learning experience, the amount of time you can dedicate each day, and the effectiveness of the learning tools at your disposal. It is also important to recognize the importance of using mnemonics along every step of the way to help you pick up all the Japanese characters and words faster! We hope that we were able to provide a guide that you can follow to help you learn Japanese starting from zero. If you want a resource that can help you every step of the way, go to [LangoBee](https://langobee.com/signup/) and use the most helpful memory strategies to help you learn Japanese!\n",
