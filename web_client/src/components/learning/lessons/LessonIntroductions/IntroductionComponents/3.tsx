            <p>
                I just want to let you know I’m really proud of you.
                When you commit to something big, especially learning a
                language such as Japanese, it can be discouraging and
                such learning a whole new system of writing and pronunciation
                but I want you to know that you’ve well made it pass
                the early stages where people tend to stop and that
                lets me know how passionate you are! Let’s take this
                passion into the next lesson where we will learn the
                “Na Gyou” characters
            </p>
