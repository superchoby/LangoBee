                So you&apos;re telling me you can now count the most common
                numbers in Japanese AND are familiar with the main greetings
                Japanese people use?! You are awesome! You’ve gone
                through all the Hiragana lessons and you’ve gone
                through some vocabulary-only lessons but now we are heading
                to some more intense lessons that involve grammar too.
                You’ll start with the basic building blocks needed to
                form sentences and it will get more advanced from there. The
                grammar will always be the last set of concepts you learn
                after each lesson&apos;s vocabulary. So now, let’s get to it!
            </p>

            <p>
                So now, let’s move on to the next set of lessons where
                we will learn all about the Japanese numbers!
