                Pssssst, let me let you in on a little secret.
            </p>

            <p>
                The truth is that up until now, all the sets of
                Hiragana we have been learning at a time have
                all contained 5 characters. This next one does too
                but I just want to let you know that after this,
                some rows only have 3 or 2 or even 1! So letâ€™s
                keep progressing and eventually we will be clearing
                rows of Hiragana like never before!
            </p>
