                I bet it must have been relaxing to be able to go
                through a lesson so quickly! Maybe you were expecting
                something longer because of how long my explanation
                was but that was just to prevent any potential confusion.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wait! But more importantly, you are on the last Hiragana lesson!
            </p>

            <p>
                Similar to the last Hiragana, this lesson is special because
                you aren’t exactly learning new characters but learning new
                rules except I promise this one is much easier to understand.
                We will be learning about Hiragana characters that have
                small marks on the top right of which changes the sound
                slightly. They can either have a either a “ (quote) like
                mark on the top right or a mark that looks like a small
                open circle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some examples are <span className='hiragana-with-symbols-example'>ぐ</span> and <span className='hiragana-with-symbols-example'>ぱ</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, by the way once you finish all the hiragana,
                romaji will no longer be appearing in future lessons.
                So you&apos;ll be able to really push yourself!
