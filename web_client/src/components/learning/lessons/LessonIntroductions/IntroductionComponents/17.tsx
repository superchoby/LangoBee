                Congratulations on getting through your lesson on verb conjugations!
                It&apos;s one of the most important and commonly used grammar points that
                you can learn. It is great that you now know the distinction between
                informal and formal verbs and can now adjust the way you speak
                according to the formality of the situation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although many different conjugation forms exist apart from the ます
                and る forms, they all follow the same core principles of having
                consistent rules depending on the verb group that they are in.
                Over time you will continue to gain an understanding of this and
                conjugations into any form will be no problem at all!
            </p>
