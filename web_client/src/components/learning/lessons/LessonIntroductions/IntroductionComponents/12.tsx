                It&apos;s awesome that you&apos;ve made it this far and have learned
                Hiragana, some of the most common Japanese words, and some
                grammar! But now, we will be taking a small break from
                grammar and vocab and take a look at Katakana now.
            </p>

            <p>
                Katakana is very similar to Hiragana because that each Hiragana
                character, except for を, has an equivalent in Katakana but what
                makes them different is that Katakana is used for words that come
                from other languages. This includes names.
            </p>

            <p>
                What you will find great about many Katakana words is their
                similarity to words in other languages and that makes it
                much easier to memorize them. For example, ストレス（すとれす）means
                “stress” in English. If you are worried you won&apos;t be able
                to get back to grammar for a while, don&apos;t worry!
                We will be going over Katakana lessons much faster
                than Hiragana so you will be getting back to doing grammar again in no time!
            </p>

            <p>
                So then, see you in the later lessons and have fun learning Katakana!
