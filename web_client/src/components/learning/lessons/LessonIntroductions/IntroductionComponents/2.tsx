                &emsp;&emsp;You’ve now completed multiple lessons, impressive!
                You are now in the double digits for the amount of
                hiragana characters you’ve learned.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;In this lesson
                you will continue to progress through the hiragana
                and learn what is known as the “Sa Gyou” which means
                the 5 Hiragana characters that start with the “s”
                noise. So far you have learned the あ gyou which
                consists of the 5 Japanese vowels and the か gyou which,
                you guessed it, consists of all the Japanese sounds
                starting with か. Now let’s go learn some of
                the sa gyou and some more cool vocabulary!
