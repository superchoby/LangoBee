                Congratulations on making it through the first lesson!
            </p>
            <p>
                By now you
                already have a good fundamental understanding of the Japanese
                language and can even read some characters as well as have
                learned some words already!
            </p>

            <p>
                For the duration of these
                kana lessons, the lessons will progress in increments of
                .5 but once you start doing lessons focused solely on
                vocabulary and grammar, they will increase in increments of one.
                Getting through the first lesson is always the biggest hurdle
                from many but you did it and that proves to me that you are dedicated
                and that makes me even more excited to teach you more! By the way,
                for the duration of these kana lessons, you will continue to see
                romaji under new vocabulary words that you learn however once you
                get past the hiragana, they will no longer be there.
            </p>

            <p>
                For now
                we will learn 5 more hiragana as well as some more essential
                words such as the word for “big” and “face”.
