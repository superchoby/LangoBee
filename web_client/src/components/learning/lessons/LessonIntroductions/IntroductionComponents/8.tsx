                How did it feel completing a lesson in which you didn’t
                have to learn any new characters? Pretty cool right?
                In the next lesson as well we will continue to learn some
                new vocabulary and afterwards we will finally learn
                grammar to piece together everything we learned. Make
                sure you remember the words you have learned as much
                as possible as these are the exact words we will use
                in our example sentences for the grammar you will learn.

                So now, let’s move on to the next set of lessons where
                we will learn all about the Japanese numbers!
