                This one is going to be a little special. We
                are actually going to clear two rows of
                Hiragana this time. That’s right, TWO rows in one
                lesson! That is because two of the Hiragana rows
                only contain 3 characters each so we decided to
                mash them up into one lesson. So let’s go and
                kill two birds with one stone!
