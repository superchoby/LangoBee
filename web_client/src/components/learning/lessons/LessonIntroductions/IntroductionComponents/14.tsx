                Yay! You have learned your first set of Katakana words!
                Now at this you are really starting to gain a mastery of
                Katakana just like you did with Hiragana and as you continue
                to learn it, your Japanese knowledge will come more and
                more close to completion!
            </p>

            <p>
                We will continue to learn more Katakana and vocabulary in
                the next lesson and the cool part is that this will be
                the last lesson for the new characters!
            </p>

            <p>
                There will still be more katakana lessons for things such as
                small characters but as for characters you have never seen
                before, this is where it ends. So let&apos;s get on with it!
