                That was A LOT of vocabulary that you just went over.
                From foods, to school subjects, to types of stores etc.
                you really have covered a lot. It’s great you were able
                to get through all that!

              </p>

              <p>
                This next lesson we will still cover more vocab but this
                will also have a grammar component as well. We will learn
                how to say the negative (“not”) form of a verb. These are
                what you will use for sentences such as, “I will not eat” or
                “She will not do it.” I&apos;m sure you can tell that these are
                some very important concepts! As with other verb conjugations,
                this will require usage of the memorizing rules according
                to their verb groups. Once you get that down, things are easy
                from there!
              </p>

              <p>
                So let&apos;s get on with the next lesson!
